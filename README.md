# Routines
App that allows users to create repeatable daily routines with a clean and simple interface. Users create routines that have start and end times, category tags, and an associated
list of tasks that users check off as they complete them. Progress of any given routine is tracked using a modern circular progress bar that updates each time a task is completed.
Users can choose to reset routines when they are ready to start again without losing their previously saved tasks.

Created using SwiftUI and core data framework.
